  <h2 class="fonty">Javascript Basics</h2>
  <p>Javascript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language.
    Javascript is extremely popular for a variety of reason. it is a small and
    lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take
    in a bunch of different directions. Javascript lives inside a host environment
    (web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these
    environments to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="#">Variable Declaration</a> Javascript variables are containers
      for storing data values  imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds
      the coffee, a variable holds a value. All Javascript variables must be
      identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers
      <span class="FU">var x;</span>
    </li>
    <li><a href="#">Variable Assignment</a>Assignment operators assign values to
      Javascript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our
      variables a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a
      variable <span class="FU">var x = 10;</span>
    </li>
    <li><a href="#">Data Types</a>Data types are an important concept; to be able
      to operate on variables, you need to know the the data type. There are six
      data types that are javascript primitives: Boolean <span class="FU">true</span>
      or <span class="FU">false</span>; <span class="FU">null</span> aka nothing;
      Number - <span class="FU">42</span> or <span class="FU">3.14</span>; String -
      <span class="FU">”Coding Dojo occasionally wastes your time</span>; Array -
      <span class="FU">[1, ‘Seriously?’, 2, ‘CD’]</span>; and Object -
      <span class="FU">{firstname:”jane”; lastname: ‘Doe’}</span>
    </li>
    <li><a href="#">Conditionals</a>When you write code, you want to perform
      different actions for different decisions - hitting different code blocks
       based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional
       statements in you code to accomplish this. There are the following
       conditional statements: <span class="FU">if</span> a specified condition is
       true, do this code in our code block; <span class="FU">else if</span> to
       specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false;<span class="FU">else</span> we execute this block of code.
     </li>
    <li><a href="#">Loops</a>There are many different kinds of loops in every
      programming language, but there are all essentially do the same thing:
      they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run
      a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. That’s
      a loop!
    </li>
    <li><a href="#">Functions</a>Functions are an encapsulation of a code block.
      When we call our function this will run that code block. Think of it as a
      list of instructions. As an example, imagine we are putting together a desk
       from Ikea: we open up the instruction manual and get started. First we
       screw the legs to the tabletop; next we place the table the right way up.
       Done! Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so let's call our function
       over and over and over and over again. </li>
